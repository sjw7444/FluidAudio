### ASR Model Compilation

Core ML first-load compile times captured on iPhone 16 Pro Max and iPhone 13 running the
parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-coreml bundle. Cold-start compilation happens the first time each Core ML model
is loaded; subsequent loads hit the cached binaries. Warm compile metrics were collected only on the
iPhone 16 Pro Max run, and only for models that were reloaded during the session.

| Model         | iPhone 16 Pro Max cold (ms) | iPhone 16 Pro Max warm (ms) | iPhone 13 cold (ms) | Compute units               |

| Decoder       |                       88.49 |                        8.11 |              146.01 | MLComputeUnits(rawValue: 1) |
| JointDecision |                       48.46 |                        7.97 |               71.85 | MLComputeUnits(rawValue: 1) |

## Text-to-Speech

We generated the same strings with to gerneate audio between 1s to ~300s in order to test the speed across a range of varying inputs on Pytorch CPU, MPS, and MLX pipeline, and compared it against the native Swift version with Core ML models.

Each pipeline warmed up the models by running through it once with pesudo inputs, and then comparing the raw inference time with the model already loaded. You can see that for the Core ML model, we traded lower memory and very slightly faster inference for longer initial warm-up.

Note that the Pytorch kokoro model in Pytorch has a memory leak issue: https://github.com/hexgrad/kokoro/issues/152

The following tests were ran on M4 Pro, 48GB RAM, Macbook Pro. If you have another device, please do try replicating it as well!

### Kokoro-82M PyTorch (MPS)

I wasn't able to run the MPS model for longer durations, even with `PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1` enabled, it kept crashing for the longer strings.

#### Swift + Fluid Audio Core ML models

Note that it does take `~15s` to compile the model on the first run, subsequent runs are shorter, we expect ~2s to load.

## Voice Activity Detection

Model is nearly identical to the base model in terms of quality, perforamnce wise we see an up to ~3.5x improvement compared to the silero Pytorch VAD model with the 256ms batch model (8 chunks of 32ms)

## Speaker Diarization

The offline version uses the community-1 model, the online version uses the legacy speaker-diarization-3.1 model.

### Offline diarzing pipeline

For slightly ~1.2% worse DER we default to a higher step ratio segmentation duration than the baseline community-1 pipeline. This allows us to get nearly ~2x the speed (as expected because we're processing 1/2 of the embeddings). For highly critical use cases, one may should use step ratio = 0.1 and minSegmentDurationSeconds = 0.0

Running on the full voxconverse benchmark:

```bash
StepRatio = 0.2, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 1.0
Average DER: 15.07% | Median DER: 10.70% | Average JER: 39.40% | Median JER: 40.95% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 122.06 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 2, min turation 1.0


StepRatio = 0.1, minSegmentDurationSeconds= 0
Average DER: 13.89% | Median DER: 10.49% | Average JER: 42.84% | Median JER: 43.30% (collar=0.25s, ignoreOverlap=True)
Average RTFx: 64.75 (from 232 clips)
Completed. New results: 232, Skipped existing: 0, Total attempted: 232
Step Ratio 1, min duration 0 (edited) 
```

Note that the baseline pytorch version is ~11% DER, we lost some precision dropping down to fp16 precision in order to run most of the emebdding model on neural engine. But as a result, we significantly out perform the baseline `mps` backend as well. the pyannote-community-1 on cpu is ~1.5-2 RTFx, on mps, it's ~20-25 RTFx.

### Streaming/online Diarization

This is more tricky and honestly a lot more fragile to clustering. Expect +10-15% worse DER for the streaming implementation. Only use this when you critically need realtime streaming speaker diarization. In most cases, offline is more than enough for most applications.
